For Bret Easton Ellis,
 whose generosity will never cease to warm my heart;
 and for Paul Edward McGloin,
 muse and Maecenas,
 who is the dearest friend I will ever have in this world.
I enquire now as to the genesis of a philologist and assert the following:
 1. A young man cannot possibly know what Greeks and Romans are.
 2. He does not know whether he is suited for finding out about them.

 Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in storytelling, and our story shall
 be the education of our heroes.

PROLOGUE
THE SNOW in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several
 weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation. He’d been
 dead for ten days before they found him, you know. It was one of the
 biggest manhunts in Vermont history—state troopers, the FBI, even an army
 helicopter; the college closed, the dye factory in Hampden shut down,
 people coming from New Hampshire, upstate New York, as far away as
 Boston.
 It is difficult to believe that Henry’s modest plan could have worked so
 well despite these unforeseen events. We hadn’t intended to hide the body
 where it couldn’t be found. In fact, we hadn’t hidden it at all but had simply
 left it where it fell in hopes that some luckless passer-by would stumble
 over it before anyone even noticed he was missing. This was a tale that told
 itself simply and well: the loose rocks, the body at the bottom of the ravine
 with a clean break in the neck, and the muddy skidmarks of dug-in heels
 pointing the way down; a hiking accident, no more, no less, and it might
 have been left at that, at quiet tears and a small funeral, had it not been for
 the snow that fell that night; it covered him without a trace, and ten days
 later, when the thaw finally came, the state troopers and the FBI and the
 searchers from the town all saw that they had been walking back and forth
 over his body until the snow above it was packed down like ice.
 It is difficult to believe that such an uproar took place over an act for which
 I was partially responsible, even more difficult to believe I could have
 walked through it—the cameras, the uniforms, the black crowds sprinkled
 over Mount Cataract like ants in a sugar bowl—without incurring a blink of
 suspicion. But walking through it all was one thing; walking away,
 unfortunately, has proved to be quite another, and though once I thought I
 had left that ravine forever on an April afternoon long ago, now I am not so
 sure. Now the searchers have departed, and life has grown quiet around me,
 I have come to realize that while for years I might have imagined myself to
 be somewhere else, in reality I have been there all the time: up at the top by
the muddy wheel-ruts in the new grass, where the sky is dark over the
 shivering apple blossoms and the first chill of the snow that will fall that
 night is already in the air.
 What are you doing up here? said Bunny, surprised, when he found the
 four of us waiting for him.
 Why, looking for new ferns, said Henry.
 And after we stood whispering in the underbrush—one last look at the
 body and a last look round, no dropped keys, lost glasses, everybody got
 everything?—and then started single file through the woods, I took one
 glance back through the saplings that leapt to close the path behind me.
 Though I remember the walk back and the first lonely flakes of snow that
 came drifting through the pines, remember piling gratefully into the car and
 starting down the road like a family on vacation, with Henry driving clench
jawed through the potholes and the rest of us leaning over the seats and
 talking like children, though I remember only too well the long terrible
 night that lay ahead and the long terrible days and nights that followed, I
 have only to glance over my shoulder for all those years to drop away and I
 see it behind me again, the ravine, rising all green and black through the
 saplings, a picture that will never leave me.
 I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories,
 but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.
BOOK I
CHAPTER
 1
 DOES SUCH a thing as “the fatal flaw,” that showy dark crack running down
 the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn’t. Now I
 think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the
 picturesque at all costs.
 A moi. L’histoire d’une de mes folies.
 My name is Richard Papen. I am twenty-eight years old and I had never
 seen New England or Hampden College until I was nineteen. I am a
 Californian by birth and also, I have recently discovered, by nature. The last
 is something I admit only now, after the fact. Not that it matters.
 I grew up in Plano, a small silicon village in the north. No sisters, no
 brothers. My father ran a gas station and my mother stayed at home until I
 got older and times got tighter and she went to work, answering phones in
 the office of one of the big chip factories outside San Jose.
 Plano. The word conjures up drive-ins, tract homes, waves of heat rising
 from the blacktop. My years there created for me an expendable past,
 disposable as a plastic cup. Which I suppose was a very great gift, in a way.
 On leaving home I was able to fabricate a new and far more satisfying
 history, full of striking, simplistic environmental influences; a colorful past,
 easily accessible to strangers.
 The dazzle of this fictive childhood—full of swimming pools and orange
 groves and dissolute, charming show-biz parents—has all but eclipsed the
 drab original. In fact, when I think about my real childhood I am unable to
 recall much about it at all except a sad jumble of objects: the sneakers I
 wore year-round; coloring books and comics from the supermarket and the
 squashed old football I contributed to neighborhood games; little of interest,
 less of beauty. I was quiet, tall for my age, prone to freckles. I didn’t have
many friends but whether this was due to choice or circumstance I do not
 now know. I did well in school, it seems, but not exceptionally well; I liked
 to read—Tom Swift, the Tolkien books—but also to watch television, which
 I did plenty of, lying on the carpet of our empty living room in the long dull
 afternoons after school.
 I honestly can’t remember much else about those years except a certain
 mood that permeated most of them, a melancholy feeling that I associate
 with watching “The Wonderful World of Disney” on Sunday nights. Sunday
 was a sad day—early to bed, school the next morning, I was constantly
 worried my homework was wrong—but as I watched the fireworks go off in
 the night sky, over the floodlit castles of Disneyland, I was consumed by a
 more general sense of dread, of imprisonment within the dreary round of
 school and home: circumstances which, to me at least, presented sound
 empirical argument for gloom. My father was mean, and our house ugly,
 and my mother didn’t pay much attention to me; my clothes were cheap and
 my haircut too short and no one at school seemed to like me that much; and
 since all this had been true for as long as I could remember, I felt things
 would doubtless continue in this depressing vein as far as I could foresee. In
 short: I felt my existence was tainted, in some subtle but essential way.
 I suppose it’s not odd, then, that I have trouble reconciling my life to
 those of my friends, or at least to their lives as I perceive them to be.
 Charles and Camilla are orphans (how I longed to be an orphan when I was
 a child!) reared by grandmothers and great-aunts in a house in Virginia: a
 childhood I like to think about, with horses and rivers and sweet-gum trees.
 And Francis. His mother, when she had him, was only seventeen—a thin
blooded, capricious girl with red hair and a rich daddy, who ran off with the
 drummer for Vance Vane and his Musical Swains. She was home in three
 weeks, and the marriage was annulled in six; and, as Francis is fond of
 saying, the grandparents brought them up like brother and sister, him and
 his mother, brought them up in such a magnanimous style that even the
 gossips were impressed—English nannies and private schools, summers in
 Switzerland, winters in France. Consider even bluff old Bunny, if you
 would. Not a childhood of reefer coats and dancing lessons, any more than
 mine was. But an American childhood. Son of a Clemson football star
 turned banker. Four brothers, no sisters, in a big noisy house in the suburbs,
 with sailboats and tennis rackets and golden retrievers; summers on Cape
Cod, boarding schools near Boston and tailgate picnics during football
 season; an upbringing vitally present in Bunny in every respect, from the
 way he shook your hand to the way he told a joke.
 I do not now nor did I ever have anything in common with any of them,
 nothing except a knowledge of Greek and the year of my life I spent in their
 company. And if love is a thing held in common, I suppose we had that in
 common, too, though I realize that might sound odd in light of the story I
 am about to tell.
 How to begin.
 After high school I went to a small college in my home town (my parents
 were opposed, as it had been made very plain that I was expected to help
 my father run his business, one of the many reasons I was in such an agony
 to escape) and, during my two years there, I studied ancient Greek. This
 was due to no love for the language but because I was majoring in pre-med
 (money, you see, was the only way to improve my fortunes, doctors make a
 lot of money, quod erat demonstrandum) and my counselor had suggested I
 take a language to fulfill the humanities requirement; and, since the Greek
 classes happened to meet in the afternoon, I took Greek so I could sleep late
 on Mondays. It was an entirely random decision which, as you will see,
 turned out to be quite fateful.
 I did well at Greek, excelled in it, and I even won an award from the
 Classics department my last year. It was my favorite class because it was
 the only one held in a regular classroom—no jars of cow hearts, no smell of
 formaldehyde, no cages full of screaming monkeys. Initially I had thought
 with hard work I could overcome a fundamental squeamishness and distaste
 for my subject, that perhaps with even harder work I could simulate
 something like a talent for it. But this was not the case. As the months went
 by I remained uninterested, if not downright sickened, by my study of
 biology; my grades were poor; I was held in contempt by teacher and
 classmate alike. In what seemed even to me a doomed and Pyrrhic gesture, I
 switched to English literature without telling my parents. I felt that I was
 cutting my own throat by this, that I would certainly be very sorry, being
 still convinced that it was better to fail in a lucrative field than to thrive in
 one that my father (who knew nothing of either finance or academia) had
 assured me was most unprofitable; one which would inevitably result in my
hanging around the house for the rest of my life asking him for money;
 money which, he assured me forcefully, he had no intention of giving me.
 So I studied literature and liked it better. But I didn’t like home any
 better. I don’t think I can explain the despair my surroundings inspired in
 me. Though I now suspect, given the circumstances and my disposition, I
 would’ve been unhappy anywhere, in Biarritz or Caracas or the Isle of
 Capri, I was then convinced that my unhappiness was indigenous to that
 place. Perhaps a part of it was. While to a certain extent Milton is right—the
 mind is its own place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell and so forth
 —it is nonetheless clear that Plano was modeled less on Paradise than that
 other, more dolorous city. In high school I developed a habit of wandering
 through shopping malls after school, swaying through the bright, chill
 mezzanines until I was so dazed with consumer goods and product codes,
 with promenades and escalators, with mirrors and Muzak and noise and
 light, that a fuse would blow in my brain and all at once everything would
 become unintelligible: color without form, a babble of detached molecules.
 Then I would walk like a zombie to the parking lot and drive to the baseball
 field, where I wouldn’t even get out of the car, just sit with my hands on the
 steering wheel and stare at the Cyclone fence and the yellowed winter grass
 until the sun went down and it was too dark for me to see.
 Though I had a confused idea that my dissatisfaction was bohemian,
 vaguely Marxist in origin (when I was a teenager I made a fatuous show of
 socialism, mainly to irritate my father), I couldn’t really begin to understand
 it; and I would have been angry if someone had suggested that it was due to
 a strong Puritan streak in my nature, which was in fact the case. Not long
 ago I found this passage in an old notebook, written when I was eighteen or
 so: “There is to me about this place a smell of rot, the smell of rot that ripe
 fruit makes. Nowhere, ever, have the hideous mechanics of birth and
 copulation and death—those monstrous upheavals of life that the Greeks
 call miasma, defilement—been so brutal or been painted up to look so
 pretty; have so many people put so much faith in lies and mutability and
 death death death.”
 This, I think, is pretty rough stuff. From the sound of it, had I stayed in
 California I might have ended up in a cult or at the very least practicing
 some weird dietary restriction. I remember reading about Pythagoras
 around this time, and finding some of his ideas curiously appealing—
wearing white garments, for instance, or abstaining from foods which have
 a soul.
 lit 
But instead I wound up on the East Coast.
 I 
on Hampden by a trick of fate. One night, during a long
 Thanksgiving holiday of rainy weather, canned cranberries, ball games
 droning from the television, I went to my room after a fight with my parents
 (I cannot remember this particular fight, only that we always fought, about
 money and school) and was tearing through my closet trying to find my
 coat when out it flew: a brochure from Hampden College, Hampden,
 Vermont.
 It was two years old, this brochure. In high school a lot of colleges had
 sent me things because I did well on my SATs, though unfortunately not
 well enough to warrant much in the way of scholarships, and this one I had
 kept in my Geometry book throughout my senior year.
 I don’t know why it was in my closet. I suppose I’d saved it because it
 was so pretty. Senior year, I had spent dozens of hours studying the
 photographs as though if I stared at them long enough and longingly
 enough I would, by some sort of osmosis, be transported into their clear,
 pure silence. Even now I remember those pictures, like pictures in a
 storybook one loved as a child. Radiant meadows, mountains vaporous in
 the trembling distance; leaves ankle-deep on a gusty autumn road; bonfires
 and fog in the valleys; cellos, dark windowpanes, snow.
 Hampden College, Hampden, Vermont. Established 1895. (This alone
 was a fact to cause wonder; nothing I knew of in Plano had been established
 much before 1962.) Student body, five hundred. Co-ed. Progressive.
 Specializing in the liberal arts. Highly selective. “Hampden, in providing a
 well-rounded course of study in the Humanities, seeks not only to give
 students a rigorous background in the chosen field but insight into all the
 disciplines of Western art, civilization, and thought. In doing so, we hope to
 provide the individual not only with facts, but with the raw materials of
 wisdom.”
 Hampden College, Hampden, Vermont. Even the name had an austere
 Anglican cadence, to my ear at least, which yearned hopelessly for England
 and was dead to the sweet dark rhythms of the little mission towns. For a
 long time I looked at a picture of the building they called Commons. It was
 suffused with a weak, academic light—different from Plano, different from
anything I had ever known—a light that made me think of long hours in
 dusty libraries, and old books, and silence.
 My mother knocked on the door, said my name. I didn’t answer. I tore
 out the information form in the back of the brochure and started to fill it in.
 Name: John Richard Papen. Address: 4487 Mimosa Court; Plano,
 California. Would you like to receive information on Financial Aid? Yes.
 And I mailed it the following morning.
 The months subsequent were an endless dreary battle of paperwork, full
 of stalemates, fought in trenches. My father refused to complete the
 financial aid papers; finally, in desperation, I stole the tax returns from the
 glove compartment of his Toyota and did them myself. More waiting. Then
 a note from the Dean of Admissions. An interview was required, and when
 could I fly to Vermont? I could not afford to fly to Vermont, and I wrote and
 told him so. Another wait, another letter. The college would reimburse me
 for my travel expenses if their scholarship offer was accepted. Meanwhile
 the financial aid packet had come in. My family’s contribution was more
 than my father said he could afford and he would not pay it. This sort of
 guerrilla warfare dragged on for eight months. Even today I do not fully
 understand the chain of events that brought me to Hampden. Sympathetic
 professors wrote letters; exceptions of various sorts were made in my case.
 And less than a year after I’d sat down on the gold shag carpet of my little
 room in Plano and impulsively filled out the questionnaire, I was getting off
 the bus in Hampden with two suitcases and fifty dollars in my pocket.
 I had never been east of Santa Fe, never north of Portland, and—when I
 stepped off the bus after a long anxious night that had begun somewhere in
 Illinois—it was six o’clock in the morning, and the sun was rising over
 mountains, and birches, and impossibly green meadows; and to me, dazed
 with night and no sleep and three days on the highway, it was like a country
 from a dream.
 The dormitories weren’t even dorms—or at any rate not like the dorms I
 knew, with cinderblock walls and depressing, yellowish light—but white
 clapboard houses with green shutters, set back from the Commons in groves
 of maple and ash. All the same it never occurred to me that my particular
 room, wherever it might be, would be anything but ugly and disappointing
 and it was with something of a shock that I saw it for the first time—a white
 room with big north-facing windows, monkish and bare, with scarred oak
floors and a ceiling slanted like a garret’s. On my first night there, I sat on
 the bed during the twilight while the walls went slowly from gray to gold to
 black, listening to a soprano’s voice climb dizzily up and down somewhere
 at the other end of the hall until at last the light was completely gone, and
 the faraway soprano spiraled on and on in the darkness like some angel of
 death, and I can’t remember the air ever seeming as high and cold and
 rarefied as it was that night, or ever feeling farther away from the low-slung
 lines of dusty Plano.
 Those first days before classes started I spent alone in my whitewashed
 room, in the bright meadows of Hampden. And I was happy in those first
 days as really I’d never been before, roaming like a sleepwalker, stunned
 and drunk with beauty. A group of red-cheeked girls playing soccer,
 ponytails flying, their shouts and laughter carrying faintly over the velvety,
 twilit field. Trees creaking with apples, fallen apples red on the grass
 beneath, the heavy sweet smell of apples rotting on the ground and the
 steady thrumming of wasps around them. Commons clock tower: ivied
 brick, white spire, spellbound in the hazy distance. The shock of first seeing
 a birch tree at night, rising up in the dark as cool and slim as a ghost. And
 the nights, bigger than imagining: black and gusty and enormous,
 disordered and wild with stars.
 I was planning to sign up for Greek again, as it was the only language at
 which I was at all proficient. But when I told this to the academic counselor
 to whom I had been assigned—a French teacher named Georges Laforgue,
 with olive skin and a pinched, long-nostriled nose like a turtle’s—he only
 smiled, and pressed the tips of his fingers together. “I am afraid there may
 be a problem,” he said, in accented English.
 “Why?”
 “There is only one teacher of ancient Greek here and he is very particular
 about his students.”
 “I’ve studied Greek for two years.”
 “That probably will not make any difference. Besides, if you are going to
 major in English literature you will need a modern language. There is still
 space left in my Elementary French class and some room in German and
Italian. The Spanish—” he consulted his list—“the Spanish classes are for
 the most part filled but if you like I will have a word with Mr. Delgado.”
 “Maybe you could speak to the Greek teacher instead.”
 “I don’t know if it would do any good. He accepts only a limited number
 of students. A very limited number. Besides, in my opinion, he conducts the
 selection on a personal rather than academic basis.”
 His voice bore a hint of sarcasm; also a suggestion that, if it was all the
 same to me, he would prefer not to continue this particular conversation.
 “I don’t know what you mean,” I said.
 Actually, I thought I did know. Laforgue’s answer surprised me. “It’s
 nothing like that,” he said. “Of course he is a distinguished scholar. He
 happens to be quite charming as well. But he has what I think are some very
 odd ideas about teaching. He and his students have virtually no contact with
 the rest of the division. I don’t know why they continue to list his courses in
 the general catalogue—it’s misleading, every year there is confusion about
 it—because, practically speaking, the classes are closed. I am told that to
 study with him one must have read the right things, hold similar views. It
 has happened repeatedly that he has turned away students such as yourself
 who have done prior work in classics. With me”—he lifted an eyebrow—“if
 the student wants to learn what I teach and is qualified, I allow him in my
 classes. Very democratic, no? It is the best way.”
 “Does that sort of thing happen often here?”
 “Of course. There are difficult teachers at every school. And plenty—” to
 my surprise, he lowered his voice—“and plenty here who are far more
 difficult than him. Though I must ask that you do not quote me on that.”
 “I won’t,” I said, a bit startled by this sudden confidential manner.
 “Really, it is quite essential that you don’t.” He was leaning forward,
 whispering, his tiny mouth scarcely moving as he spoke. “I must insist.
 Perhaps you are not aware of this but I have several formidable enemies in
 the Literature Division. Even, though you may scarcely believe it, here in
 my own department. Besides,” he continued in a more normal tone, “he is a
 special case. He has taught here for many years and even refuses payment
 for his work.”
 “Why?”
 “He is a wealthy man. He donates his salary to the college, though he
 accepts, I think, one dollar a year for tax purposes.”
“Oh,” I said. Even though I had been at Hampden only a few days, I was
 already accustomed to the official accounts of financial hardship, of limited
 endowment, of corners cut.
 “Now me,” said Laforgue, “I like to teach well enough, but I have a wife
 and a daughter in school in France—the money comes in handy, yes?”
 “Maybe I’ll talk to him anyway.”
 Laforgue shrugged. “You can try. But I advise you not to make an
 appointment, or probably he will not see you. His name is Julian Morrow.”
 I had not been particularly bent on taking Greek, but what Laforgue said
 intrigued me. I went downstairs and walked into the first office I saw. A
 thin, sour-looking woman with tired blond hair was sitting at the desk in the
 front room, eating a sandwich.
 “It’s my lunch hour,” she said. “Come back at two.”
 “I’m sorry. I’m just looking for a teacher’s office.”
 “Well, I’m the registrar, not the switchboard. But I might know. Who is
 it?”
 “Julian Morrow.”
 “Oh, him,” she said, surprised. “What do you want with him? He’s
 upstairs, I think, in the Lyceum.”
 “What room?”
 “Only teacher up there. Likes his peace and quiet. You’ll find him.”
 Actually, finding the Lyceum wasn’t easy at all. It was a small building
 on the edge of campus, old and covered with ivy in such a manner as to be
 almost indistinguishable from its landscape. Downstairs were lecture halls
 and classrooms, all of them empty, with clean blackboards and freshly
 waxed floors. I wandered around helplessly until finally I noticed the
 staircase—small and badly lit—in the far corner of the building.
 Once at the top I found myself in a long, deserted hallway. Enjoying the
 noise of my shoes on the linoleum, I walked along briskly, looking at the
 closed doors for numbers or names until I came to one that had a brass card
 holder and, within it, an engraved card that read JULIAN MORROW. I stood there
 for a moment and then I knocked, three short raps.
 A minute or so passed, and another, and then the white door opened just a
 crack. A face looked out at me. It was a small, wise face, as alert and poised
 as a question; and though certain features of it were suggestive of youth—
the elfin upsweep of the eyebrows, the deft lines of nose and jaw and mouth
 —it was by no means a young face, and the hair was snow white.
 I stood there for a moment as he blinked at me.
 “How may I help you?” The voice was reasonable and kind, in the way
 that pleasant adults sometimes have with children.
 “I—well, my name is Richard Papen—”
 He put his head to the side and blinked again, bright-eyed, amiable as a
 sparrow.
 “—and I want to take your class in ancient Greek.”
 His face fell. “Oh. I’m sorry.” His tone of voice, incredibly enough,
 seemed to suggest that he really was sorry, sorrier than I was. “I can’t think
 of anything I’d like better, but I’m afraid there isn’t any room. My class is
 already filled.”
 Something about this apparently sincere regret gave me courage. “Surely
 there must be some way,” I said. “One extra student—”
 “I’m terribly sorry, Mr. Papen,” he said, almost as if he were consoling
 me on the death of a beloved friend, trying to make me understand that he
 was powerless to help me in any substantial way. “But I have limited
 myself to five students and I cannot even think of adding another.”
 “Five students is not very many.”
 He shook his head quickly, eyes shut, as if entreaty were more than he
 could bear.
 “Really, I’d love to have you, but I mustn’t even consider it,” he said.
 “I’m terribly sorry. Will you excuse me now? I have a student with me.”
 More than a week went by. I started my classes and got a job with a
 professor of psychology named Dr. Roland. (I was to assist him in some
 vague “research,” the nature of which I never discovered; he was an old,
 dazed, disordered-looking fellow, a behavioralist, who spent most of his
 time loitering in the teachers’ lounge.) And I made some friends, most of
 them freshmen who lived in my house. Friends is perhaps an inaccurate
 word to use. We ate our meals together, saw each other coming and going,
 but mainly were thrown together by the fact that none of us knew anybody
 —a situation which, at the time, did not seem necessarily unpleasant.
Among the few people I had met who’d been at Hampden awhile, I asked
 what the story was with Julian Morrow.
 Nearly everyone had heard of him, and I was given all sorts of
 contradictory but fascinating information: that he was a brilliant man; that
 he was a fraud; that he had no college degree; that he had been a great
 intellectual in the forties, and a friend to Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot; that his
 family money had come from a partnership in a white-shoe banking firm or,
 conversely, from the purchase of foreclosed property during the Depression;
 that he had dodged the draft in some war (though chronologically this was
 difficult to compute); that he had ties with the Vatican; a deposed royal
 family in the Middle East; Franco’s Spain. The degree of truth in any of this
 was, of course, unknowable but the more I heard about him, the more
 interested I became, and I began to watch for him and his little group of
 pupils around campus. Four boys and a girl, they were nothing so unusual at
 a distance. At close range, though, they were an arresting party—at least to
 me, who had never seen anything like them, and to whom they suggested a
 variety of picturesque and fictive qualities.
 Two of the boys wore glasses, curiously enough the same kind: tiny, old
fashioned, with round steel rims. The larger of the two—and he was quite
 large, well over six feet—was dark-haired, with a square jaw and coarse,
 pale skin. He might have been handsome had his features been less set, or
 his eyes, behind the glasses, less expressionless and blank. He wore dark
 English suits and carried an umbrella (a bizarre sight in Hampden) and he
 walked stiffly through the throngs of hippies and beatniks and preppies and
 punks with the self-conscious formality of an old ballerina, surprising in
 one so large as he. “Henry Winter,” said my friends when I pointed him out,
 at a distance, making a wide circle to avoid a group of bongo players on the
 lawn.
 The smaller of the two—but not by much—was a sloppy blond boy, rosy
cheeked and gum-chewing, with a relentlessly cheery demeanor and his
 fists thrust deep in the pockets of his knee-sprung trousers. He wore the
 same jacket every day, a shapeless brown tweed that was frayed at the
 elbows and short in the sleeves, and his sandy hair was parted on the left, so
 a long forelock fell over one bespectacled eye. Bunny Corcoran was his
 name, Bunny being somehow short for Edmund. His voice was loud and
 honking, and carried in the dining halls.
The third boy was the most exotic of the set. Angular and elegant, he was
 precariously thin, with nervous hands and a shrewd albino face and a short,
 fiery mop of the reddest hair I had ever seen. I thought (erroneously) that he
 dressed like Alfred Douglas, or the Comte de Montesquiou: beautiful
 starchy shirts with French cuffs; magnificent neckties; a black greatcoat that
 billowed behind him as he walked and made him look like a cross between
 a student prince and Jack the Ripper. Once, to my delight, I even saw him
 wearing pince-nez. (Later, I discovered that they weren’t real pince-nez, but
 only had glass in them, and that his eyes were a good deal sharper than my
 own.) Francis Abernathy was his name. Further inquiries elicited suspicion
 from male acquaintances, who wondered at my interest in such a person.
 And then there were a pair, boy and girl. I saw them together a great deal,
 and at first I thought they were boyfriend and girlfriend, until one day I saw
 them up close and realized they had to be siblings. Later I learned they were
 twins. They looked very much alike, with heavy dark-blond hair and
 epicene faces as clear, as cheerful and grave, as a couple of Flemish angels.
 And perhaps most unusual in the context of Hampden—where pseudo
intellects and teenage decadents abounded, and where black clothing was de
 rigueur—they liked to wear pale clothes, particularly white. In this swarm
 of cigarettes and dark sophistication they appeared here and there like
 figures from an allegory, or long-dead celebrants from some forgotten
 garden party. It was easy to find out who they were, as they shared the
 distinction of being the only twins on campus. Their names were Charles
 and Camilla Macaulay.
 All of them, to me, seemed highly unapproachable. But I watched them
 with interest whenever I happened to see them: Francis, stooping to talk to a
 cat on a doorstep; Henry dashing past at the wheel of a little white car, with
 Julian in the passenger’s seat; Bunny leaning out of an upstairs window to
 yell something at the twins on the lawn below. Slowly, more information
 came my way. Francis Abernathy was from Boston and, from most
 accounts, quite wealthy. Henry, too, was said to be wealthy; what’s more, he
 was a linguistic genius. He spoke a number of languages, ancient and
 modern, and had published a translation of Anacreon, with commentary,
 when he was only eighteen. (I found this out from Georges Laforgue, who
 was otherwise sour and reticent on the topic; later I discovered that Henry,
 during his freshman year, had embarrassed Laforgue badly in front of the
entire literature faculty during the question-and-answer period of his annual
 lecture on Racine.) The twins had an apartment off campus, and were from
 somewhere down south. And Bunny Corcoran had a habit of playing John
 Philip Sousa march tunes in his room, at full volume, late at night.
 Not to imply that I was overly preoccupied with any of this. I was settling
 in at school by this time; classes had begun and I was busy with my work.
 My interest in Julian Morrow and his Greek pupils, though still keen, was
 starting to wane when a curious coincidence happened.
 It happened the Wednesday morning of my second week, when I was in
 the library making some Xeroxes for Dr. Roland before my eleven o’clock
 class. After about thirty minutes, spots of light swimming in front of my
 eyes, I went back to the front desk to give the Xerox key to the librarian and
 as I turned to leave I saw them, Bunny and the twins, sitting at a table that
 was spread with papers and pens and bottles of ink. The bottles of ink I
 remember particularly, because I was very charmed by them, and by the
 long black straight pens, which looked incredibly archaic and troublesome.
 Charles was wearing a white tennis sweater, and Camilla a sun dress with a
 sailor collar, and a straw hat. Bunny’s tweed jacket was slung across the
 back of his chair, exposing several large rips and stains in the lining. He
 was leaning his elbows on the table, hair in eyes, his rumpled shirtsleeves
 held up with striped garters. Their heads were close together and they were
 talking quietly.
 I 
suddenly wanted to know what they were saying. I went to the
 bookshelf behind their table—the long way, as if I wasn’t sure what I was
 looking for—all the way down until I was so close I could’ve reached out
 and touched Bunny’s arm. My back to them, I picked a book at random—a
 ridiculous sociological text, as it happened—and pretended to study the
 index. Secondary Analysis. Secondary Deviance. Secondary Groups.
 Secondary Schools.
 “I don’t know about that,” Camilla was saying. “If the Greeks are sailing
 to Carthage, it should be accusative. Remember? Place whither? That’s the
 rule.”
 “Can’t be.” This was Bunny. His voice was nasal, garrulous, W. C. Fields
 with a bad case of Long Island lockjaw. “It’s not place whither, it’s place to.
 I put my money on the ablative case.”
 There was a confused rattling of papers.
“Wait,” said Charles. His voice was a lot like his sister’s—hoarse,
 slightly southern. “Look at this. They’re not just sailing to Carthage, they’re
 sailing to attack it.”
 “You’re crazy.”
 “No, they are. Look at the next sentence. We need a dative.”
 “Are you sure?”
 More rustling of papers.
 “Absolutely. Epi tō karchidona.”
 “I don’t see how,” said Bunny. He sounded like Thurston Howell on
 “Gilligan’s Island.” “Ablative’s the ticket. The hard ones are always
 ablative.”
 A slight pause. “Bunny,” said Charles, “you’re mixed up. The ablative is
 in Latin.”
 “Well, of course, I know that,” said Bunny irritably, after a confused
 pause which seemed to indicate the contrary, “but you know what I mean.
 Aorist, ablative, all the same thing, really …”
 “Look, Charles,” said Camilla. “This dative won’t work.”
 “Yes it will. They’re sailing to attack, aren’t they?”
 “Yes, but the Greeks sailed over the sea to Carthage.”
 “But I put that epi in front of it.”
 “Well, we can attack and still use epi, but we have to use an accusative
 because of the first rules.”
 Segregation. Self. Self-concept. I looked down at the index and racked
 my brains for the case they were looking for. The Greeks sailed over the sea
 to Carthage. To Carthage. Place whither. Place whence. Carthage.
 Suddenly something occurred to me. I closed the book and put it on the
 shelf and turned around. “Excuse me?” I said.
 Immediately they stopped talking, startled, and turned to stare at me.
 “I’m sorry, but would the locative case do?”
 Nobody said anything for a long moment.
 “Locative?” said Charles.
 “Just add zde to karchido,” I said. “I think it’s zde. If you use that, you
 won’t need a preposition, except the epi if they’re going to war. It implies
 ‘Carthage-ward,’ so you won’t have to worry about a case, either.”
 Charles looked at his paper, then at me. “Locative?” he said. “That’s
 pretty obscure.”
“Are you sure it exists for Carthage?” said Camilla.
 I hadn’t thought of this. “Maybe not,” I said. “I know it does for Athens.”
 Charles reached over and hauled the lexicon towards him over the table
 and began to leaf through it.
 “Oh, hell, don’t bother,” said Bunny stridently. “If you don’t have to
 decline it and it doesn’t need a preposition it sounds good to me.” He reared
 back in his chair and looked up at me. “I’d like to shake your hand,
 stranger.” I offered it to him; he clasped and shook it firmly, almost
 knocking an ink bottle over with his elbow as he did so. “Glad to meet you,
 yes, yes,” he said, reaching up with the other hand to brush the hair from his
 eyes.
 I 
was confused by this sudden glare of attention; it was as if the
 characters in a favorite painting, absorbed in their own concerns, had
 looked up out of the canvas and spoken to me. Only the day before Francis,
 in a swish of black cashmere and cigarette smoke, had brushed past me in a
 corridor. For a moment, as his arm touched mine, he was a creature of flesh
 and blood, but the next he was a hallucination again, a figment of the
 imagination stalking down the hallway as heedless of me as ghosts, in their
 shadowy rounds, are said to be heedless of the living.
 Charles, still fumbling with the lexicon, rose and offered his hand. “My
 name is Charles Macaulay.”
 “Richard Papen.”
 “Oh, you’re the one,” said Camilla suddenly.
 “What?”
 “You. You came by to ask about the Greek class.”
 “This is my sister,” said Charles, “and this is—Bun, did you tell him your
 name already?”
 “No, no, don’t think so. You’ve made me a happy man, sir. We had ten
 more like this to do and five minutes to do them in. Edmund Corcoran’s the
 name,” said Bunny, grasping my hand again.
 “How long have you studied Greek?” said Camilla.
 “Two years.”
 “You’re rather good at it.”
 “Pity you aren’t in our class,” said Bunny.
 A strained silence.
“Well,” said Charles uncomfortably, “Julian is funny about things like
 that.”
 “Go see him again, why don’t you,” Bunny said. “Take him some flowers
 and tell him you love Plato and he’ll be eating out of your hand.”
 Another silence, this one more disagreeable than the first. Camilla
 smiled, not exactly at me—a sweet, unfocused smile, quite impersonal, as if
 I were a waiter or a clerk in a store. Beside her Charles, who was still
 standing, smiled too and raised a polite eyebrow—a gesture which might
 have been nervous, might have meant anything, really, but which I took to
 mean Is that all?
 I mumbled something and was about to turn away when Bunny—who
 was staring in the opposite direction—shot out an arm and grabbed me by
 the wrist. “Wait,” he said.
 Startled, I looked up. Henry had just come in the door—dark suit,
 umbrella, and all.
 When he got to the table he pretended not to see me. “Hello,” he said to
 them. “Are you finished?”
 Bunny tossed his head at me. “Look here, Henry, we’ve got someone to
 meet you,” he said.
 Henry glanced up. His expression did not change. He shut his eyes and
 then reopened them, as if he found it extraordinary that someone such as
 myself should stand in his path of vision.
 “Yes, yes,” said Bunny. “This man’s name is Richard—Richard what?”
 “Papen.”
 “Yes, yes. Richard Papen. Studies Greek.”
 Henry brought his head up to look at me. “Not here, surely,” he said.
 “No,” I said, meeting his gaze, but his stare was so rude I was forced to
 cut my eyes away.
 “Oh, Henry, look at this, would you,” said Charles hastily, rustling
 through the papers again. “We were going to use a dative or an accusative
 here but he suggested locative?”
 Henry leaned over his shoulder and inspected the page. “Hmm, archaic
 locative,” he said. “Very Homeric. Of course, it would be grammatically
 correct but perhaps a bit off contextually.” He brought his head back up to
 scrutinize me. The light was at an angle that glinted off his tiny spectacles,
and I couldn’t see his eyes behind them. “Very interesting. You’re a
 Homeric scholar?”
 I might have said yes, but I had the feeling he would be glad to catch me
 in a mistake, and that he would be able to do it easily. “I like Homer,” I said
 weakly.
 He regarded me with chill distaste. “I love Homer,” he said. “Of course
 we’re studying things rather more modern, Plato and the tragedians and so
 forth.”
 I 
was trying to think of some response when he looked away in
 disinterest.
 “We should go,” he said.
 Charles shuffled his papers together, stood up again; Camilla stood
 beside him and this time she offered me her hand, too. Side by side, they
 were very much alike, in similarity less of lineament than of manner and
 bearing, a correspondence of gesture which bounced and echoed between
 them so that a blink seemed to reverberate, moments later, in a twitch of the
 other’s eyelid. Their eyes were the same color of gray, intelligent and calm.
 She, I thought, was very beautiful, in an unsettling, almost medieval way
 which would not be apparent to the casual observer.
 Bunny pushed his chair back and slapped me between the shoulder
 blades. “Well, sir,” he said, “we must get together sometime and talk about
 Greek, yes?”
 “Goodbye,” Henry said, with a nod.
 “Goodbye,” I said. They strolled off and I stood where I was and watched
 them go, walking out of the library in a wide phalanx, side by side.
 When I went by Dr. Roland’s office a few minutes later to drop off the
 Xeroxes, I asked him if he could give me an advance on my work-study
 check.
 He leaned back in his chair and trained his watery, red-rimmed eyes on
 me. “Well, you know,” he said, “for the past ten years, I’ve made it my
 practice not to do that. Let me tell you why that is.”
 “I know, sir,” I said hastily. Dr. Roland’s discourses on his “practices”
 could sometimes take half an hour or more. “I understand. Only it’s kind of
 an emergency.”
He leaned forward again and cleared his throat. “And what,” he said,
 “might that be?”
 His hands, folded on the desk before him, were gnarled with veins and
 had a bluish, pearly sheen around the knuckles. I stared at them. I needed
 ten or twenty dollars, needed it badly, but I had come in without first
 deciding what to say. “I don’t know,” I said. “Something has come up.”
 He furrowed his eyebrows impressively. Dr. Roland’s senile manner was
 said to be a facade; to me it seemed quite genuine but sometimes, when you
 were off your guard, he would display an unexpected flash of lucidity,
 which—though it frequently did not relate to the topic at hand—was
 evidence that rational processes rumbled somewhere in the muddied depths
 of his consciousness.
 “It’s my car,” I said, suddenly inspired. I didn’t have a car. “I need to get
 it fixed.”
 I 
had not expected him to inquire further but instead he perked up
 noticeably. “What’s the trouble?”
 “Something with the transmission.”
 “Is it dual-pathed? Air-cooled?”
 “Air-cooled,” I said, shifting to the other foot. I did not care for the
 conversational turn. I don’t know a thing about cars and am hard-pressed to
 change a tire.
 “What’ve you got, one of those little V-6 numbers?”
 “Yes.”
 “I’m not surprised. All the kids seem to crave them.”
 I had no idea how to respond to this.
 He pulled out his desk drawer and began to pick things up and bring
 them close to his eyes and put them back in again. “Once a transmission
 goes,” he said, “in my experience the car is gone. Especially on a V-6. You
 might as well take that vehicle to the junk heap. Now, myself, I’ve got a 98
 Regency Brougham, ten years old. With me, it’s regular checkups, new
 filter every fifteen hundred miles, and new oil every three thousand. Runs
 like a dream. Watch out for these garages in town,” he said sharply.
 “Pardon?”
 He’d found his checkbook at last. “Well, you ought to go to the Bursar
 but I guess this’ll be all right,” he said, opening it and beginning to write
 laboriously. “Some of these places in Hampden, they find out you’re from
the college, they’ll charge you double. Redeemed Repair is generally the
 best—they’re a bunch of born-agains down there but they’ll still shake you
 down pretty good if you don’t keep an eye on them.”
 He tore out the check and handed it to me. I glanced at it and my heart
 skipped a beat. Two hundred dollars. He’d signed it and everything.
 “Don’t you let them charge you a penny more,” he said.
 “No sir,” I said, barely able to conceal my joy. What would I do with all
 this money? Maybe he would even forget he had given it to me.
 He pulled down his glasses and looked at me over the tops of them.
 “That’s Redeemed Repair,” he said. “They’re out on Highway 6. The sign is
 shaped like a cross.”
 “Thank you,” I said.
 I walked down the hall with spirits soaring, and two hundred dollars in
 my pocket, and the first thing I did was to go downstairs to the pay phone
 and call a cab to take me into Hampden town. If there’s one thing I’m good
 at, it’s lying on my feet. It’s sort of a gift I have.
 And what did I do in Hampden town? Frankly, I was too staggered by my
 good fortune to do much of anything. It was a glorious day; I was sick of
 being poor, so, before I thought better of it, I went into an expensive men’s
 shop on the square and bought a couple of shirts. Then I went down to the
 Salvation Army and poked around in bins for a while and found a Harris
 tweed overcoat and a pair of brown wingtips that fit me, also some cufflinks
 and a funny old tie that had pictures of men hunting deer on it. When I
 came out of the store I was happy to find that I still had nearly a hundred
 dollars. Should I go to the bookstore? To the movies? Buy a bottle of
 Scotch? In the end, I was so swarmed by the flock of possibilities that
 drifted up murmuring and smiling to crowd about me on the bright autumn
 sidewalk that—like a farm boy flustered by a bevy of prostitutes—I brushed
 right through them, to the pay phone on the corner, to call a cab to take me
 to school.
 Once in my room, I spread the clothes on my bed. The cufflinks were
 beaten up and had someone else’s initials on them, but they looked like real
 gold, glinting in the drowsy autumn sun which poured through the window
 and soaked in yellow pools on the oak floor—voluptuous, rich, intoxicating.
